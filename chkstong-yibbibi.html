    <p>This is an attempt to get this page indexed by <a href="https://google.com" style="text-decoration: none;">Google</a> and ranked first when searching for the term: chkstong yibbibi. This is a contest for my CSCE 470 class, where we're combining the terms Chkstong and Yibbibi to try to get them indexed.
